## ⚠️ IMPORTANT - KEEP WINDOWS OPEN

**You Need TWO Windows Running:**

### **Window 1: Dev Server**
```
npm run dev
```
Shows: "Network: http://172.31.133.189:5173/"

### **Window 2: LocalTunnel**
```
npx localtunnel --port 5173
```
Shows: "your url is: https://beige-dingos-slide.loca.lt"

**Do NOT close either window!**

---

## 🔄 If Connection Drops

### **Restart Both Services:**

**Step 1: Restart Dev Server**
```powershell
cd C:\Users\INDIAN\mediro-frontend
npm run dev
```

**Step 2: Restart Tunnel** (in new PowerShell)
```powershell
npx localtunnel --port 5173
```

**Step 3: Note New URL**
You'll get a new URL like: `https://[random-words].loca.lt`

## 💡 UNDERSTANDING THE SETUP

### **How It Works:**
1. **Dev Server (Port 5173)**: Runs your website locally
2. **LocalTunnel**: Creates secure tunnel from internet → your computer
3. **Public URL**: Anyone types URL → tunnel → your computer → website

### **Network Flow:**
